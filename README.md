Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

On all pages, there is a navigation bar towards the left side.
index.html or the Homepage simply contains the jumbotron Bootstrap component as an introduction to the website.
aboutme.html contains information mostly about classes that I am taking right now, as well as classes that I will take during the
school year. In that file, I make use of unordered lists and a table to display this info. college.html makes use of images and an ordered list.
career.html mostly contains basic html elements.

I'm not sure if I can request specific comments, but if possible, I think it would be super helpful if I could receive comments on
efficient ways to program, naming or organizational conventions to follow, possibly design feedback, tips to maintain website consistency, and what to comment on. Thank you in advance!
